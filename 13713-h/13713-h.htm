<h2>NOTES</h2>
<h3>DR. JOHNSON AND DR. WARTON.</h3>
<p>Amongst the poems of the Rev. Thos. Warton, vicar of
Basingstoke, who is best remembered as the father of two celebrated
sons, is one entitled <i>The Universal Love of Pleasure</i>,
commencing&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"All human race, from China to Peru,</p>
<p>Pleasure, howe'er disguised by art, pursue."</p>
<p>&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Warton died in 1745, and his Poems were published in 1748.</p>
<p>Johnson's <i>Vanity of Human Wishes</i> appeared in 1749; but
Boswell believes that it was composed in the preceding year. That
Poem, as we well remember, commences thus tamely:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Let observation with extensive view,</p>
<p>Survey Mankind from China to Peru."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Though so immeasurably inferior to his own, Johnson may have
noticed these verses of Warton's with some little attention, and
unfortunately borrowed the only prosaic lines in his poem. Besides
the imitation before quoted, both writers allude to Charles of
Sweden. Thus Warton says,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'Twas hence rough Charles rush'd forth to ruthless war."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Johnson, in his highly finished picture of the same monarch,
says,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"War sounds the trump, he rushes to the field."</p>
</div>

<h3>SPENSER'S MONUMENT.</h3>
<p>In the <i>Lives of English Poets</i>, by William Winstanley
(London, printed by H. Clark for Samuel Manship, 1687), in his
account of Spenser, p. 92., he says, "he died anno 1598, and was
honourably buried at the sole charge of Robert, first of that name,
Earl of Essex, on whose monument is written this
epitaph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Edmundus Spenser, Londinensis, Anglicorum poetarum nostri
seculi fuit princeps, quod ejus Poemata, faventibus Musis, et
victuro genio conscripa comprobant. Obiit immatura morte, anno
salutis 1598, et prope Galfredum Chaucerum conditur, qui
foelicisime Poesin Anglicis literis primus illustravit. In quem
h&aelig;c scripta sunt Epitaphia.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Hic prope Chaucerum situs est Spenserius, illi</p>
<p class="i2">Prominens ingenio, proximum ut tumulo</p>
<p>Hic prope Chaucerum Spensere poeta poetam</p>
<p class="i2">Conderis, et versud quam tumulo proprior,</p>
<p>Anglica te vivo vixit, plausitque l'oesis;</p>
<p class="i2">Nunc moritura timet, te moriente mori."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I have also a folio copy of Spenser, printed by Henry Hills for
Jonathan Edwin, London, 1679. In a short life therein printed, it
says that he was buried near Chaucer, 1596; and the frontispiece is
an engraving of his tomb, by E. White, which bears this
epitaph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Heare lyes (expecting the second comminge of our Saviour,
Christ Jesus) the body of Edmond Spenser, the Prince of Poets in
his tyme, whose Divine spirit needs noe othir witness than the
works which he left behind <span class="pagenum"><a name="page482"
id="page482"></a>{482}</span> him. He was borne in London in the
yeare 1510, and died in the yeare 1596."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beneath are these lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Such is the tombs the Noble Essex gave</p>
<p class="i2">Great Spenser's learned reliques, such his grave:</p>
<p class="i2">Howe'er ill-treated in his life he were,</p>
<p class="i2">His sacred bones rest honourably here."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>How are these two epitaphs, with their differing dates, to be
reconciled? Can he have been born in 1510, as the first one says
"obiit <i>immatur&acirc;</i> morte?" Now eighty-five is not very
immature; and I believe he entered at Pembroke College, Cambridge,
in 1569, at which time he would be fifty-nine, and that at a period
when college education commenced at an earlier age than now.
Vertue's portrait, engraved 1727, takes as a motto the last two
lines of the first epitaph&mdash;"Anglica te vivo," &amp;c.</p>

<h3>BORROWED THOUGHTS.</h3>
<p>Crenius wrote a dissertation <i>De Furibus Librariis</i>, and J.
Conrad Schwarz another <i>De Plagio Literario</i>, in which some
curious appropriations are pointed out; your pages have already
contained some additional recent instances. The writers thus
pillaged might exclaim, "Pereant iste qui <i>post</i> nos nostra
dixerunt." Two or three instances have occurred to me which, I
think, have not been noticed. Goldsmith's <i>Madame Blaize</i> is
known to be a free version of <i>La fameuse La Galisse</i>. His
well-known epigram,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Here lies poor Ned Purdon, from misery freed,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>is borrowed from the following by the Chevalier de Cailly (or
d'Aceilly, as he writes himself) entitled,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"<i>La Mort du Sieur Etienne</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Il est au bout de ses travaux,</p>
<p class="i2">Il a pass&eacute; le Sieur Etienne;</p>
<p class="i2">En ce monde il eut tant des maux,</p>
<p class="i2">Qu'on ne croit pas qu'il revienne."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another well-know epigram,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"I do not like thee, Doctor Fell,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>is merely a version of the 33d epigram of the first books of
those by the witty Roger de Bussy, Comte de Rabutin:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Je ne vous aime pas, Hylas,</p>
<p class="i2">Je n'en saurois dire la cause,</p>
<p class="i2">Je sais seulement une chose;</p>
<p class="i2">C'est que je ne vous aime pas."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lastly, Prior's epitaph on himself has its prototype in one long
previously written by or for one John Carnegie:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Johnnie Carnegie lais heer,</p>
<p class="i4">Descendit of Adam and Eve,</p>
<p class="i2">Gif ony con gang hieher,</p>
<p class="i4">I'se willing gie him leve."</p>
</div>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>
<p><i>Easter Eggs</i> (No. 25. p. 397.).&mdash;The custom recorded
by Brande as being in use in the North of England in his time,
still continues in Richmondshire.</p>
<p><i>A Cure for Warts</i> is practised with the utmost faith in
East Sussex. The nails are cut, the cuttings carefully wrapped in
paper, and placed in the hollow of a pollard ash, concealed from
the birds; when the paper decays, the warts disappear. For this I
can vouch: in my own case the paper did decay, and the warts did
all disappear, and, of course, the effect was produced by the
cause. Does the practice exist elsewhere?</p>
<p><i>Charm for Wounds.</i>&mdash;Boys, in his <i>History of
Sandwich</i>, gives, (p. 690.) the following from the Corporation
Records, 1568: a woman examined touching her power to charm wounds
who&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sayesth that she can charme for fyer and skalding in forme as
oulde women do, sayeng 'Owt fyer in frost, in the name of the
Father, the Sonne, and the Holly Ghost;' and she hath used when the
skyn of children do cleve fast, to advise the mother to annoynt
them with the mother's milk and oyle olyfe; and for skalding to
take oyle olyfe only."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="author">W. DURRANT COOPER.</p>
<p><i>Fifth Son.</i>&mdash;What is the superstition relating to a
fifth son? I should be glad of any illustrations of it. There
certainly are instances in which the fifth son has been the most
distinguished scion of the family.</p>
<p class="author">W.S.G.</p>
<p><i>Cwn Wybir, or Cwn Annwn</i>&mdash;<i>Curlews</i> (No. 19. p.
294).&mdash;The late ingenious and well-informed Mr. William Weston
Young, then residing in Glamorgan, gave me the following exposition
of these mysterious <i>Dogs of the Sky</i>, or <i>Dogs of the
Abyss</i>, whose a&euml;rial cries at first perplexed as well as
startled him. He was in the habit of traversing wild tracts of
country, in his profession of land surveyor and often rode by
night. One intensely dark night he was crossing a desolate range of
hills, when he heard a most diabolical yelping and shrieking in the
air, horrible enough in such a region and at black midnight. He was
not, however, a superstitious man, and, being an observant
naturalist, had paid great attention to the notes of birds, and the
remarkable variations between the day and night notes of the same
species. He suspected these strange unearthly sounds to be made by
some gregarious birds on the wing; but <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page483" id="page483"></a>{483}</span> the
darkness was impenetrable, and he gazed upwards in vain. The
noises, meanwhile, were precisely those which he had heard ascribed
to the <i>Cwn Wybir</i>, and would have been truly appalling to a
superstitious imagination. His quick ear at length caught the rush
of pinions, and, in a short time, a large flight of curlews came
sweeping down to the heather, so near his head, that some of their
wings brushed his hat. They were no sooner settled, than the <i>Cwn
Wybir</i> ceased to be heard. Mr. Young then recollected having
noticed similar nocturnal cries from the curlew, but had never
before encountered such a formidable flying legion of those birds,
screaming in a great variety of keys, amidst mountain echoes.</p>

<h3>BARTHOLOMEW LEGATE, THE MARTYR.</h3>
<p>An erroneous date, resting on such authorities as Mr. Hallam and
Mr. J. Payne Collier, deserves a note. The former in his <i>Const.
Hist.</i> (ii. 275. note, second edition), and the latter in the
<i>Egerton Papers</i>, printed for the Camden Society (p. 446.),
assigns the date 1614 to the death of Bartholomew Legate at
Smithfield. The latter also gives the date March 13. Now the true
date is March 18, 1611-12, as will appear by consulting&mdash;1.
The commissions and warrants for the burning of Legate and
Wightman, inserted in <i>Truth brought to Light, or the Narrative
History of King James for the first Fourteen Years</i>, 4to. 1651;
2. Chamberlain's <i>Letters to Sir Dudley Carleton</i>, dated Feb.
26, 1611 (1611-12), and March 25, 1612, printed in <i>The Court and
Times of James I.</i>, vol. i. pp. 136. 164.; and 3. Wallace's
<i>Antitrinitarian Biography</i>, vol. ii. p. 534. Fuller, in his
<i>Church History</i>, gives the correct date, and states that his
"burning of heretics much startled common people;" "wherefore King
James politicly preferred that heretics hereafter, though
condemned, should silently and privately waste themselves away in
the prison."</p>
<p>Legate and Wightman were, in fact, the last martyrs burnt at the
stake in England for their religious opinions.</p>
<p class="author">A.B.R.</p>
<hr />
<h3>BOHN'S EDITION OF MILTON'S PROSE WORKS.</h3>
<p>Three volumes of this edition have already appeared, the last
bearing the date of 1848, and concluding thus:&mdash;"End of Vol.
III." In the latest Catalogue, which Mr. Bohn has appended to his
publications, appears a notice of "Milton's Prose Works,
<i>complete</i> in 3 vols." This word <i>complete</i> is not
consistent with the words terminating the last volume, nor with the
exact truth. For instance, the History of Britain does not find a
place in this edition; and I can hardly believe that Mr. Bohn
originally intended that the Prose Works of Milton should be issued
from his press without a full index. Without such an index, this
edition is comparatively worthless to the investigator of history.
I would therefore suggest to Mr. Bohn (whose services to literature
I most gratefully acknowledge), that he should render his edition
of Milton's Prose Works <i>really complete</i>, by issuing a fourth
volume, which <i>inter alia</i>, might contain the <i>Latin</i>
prose works of Milton, reprinted in Fletcher's edition of 1834,
together with any omitted English prose work of the author, and be
terminated, as is usual in Mr. Bohn's publications, with a full
alphabetical index, embracing both persons and things. The lover of
historical pursuits would then have <i>fresh</i> reason to thank
Mr. Bohn.</p>
<p class="author">N.</p>

<h3>REPRINT OF JEREMY TAYLOR'S WORKS.</h3>
<p>A reprint being called for of vol. iv. of <i>Bishop Jeremy
Taylor's Works</i>, now in course of publication, I would beg
permission to make it known to your readers, that assistance in
regard to any references which were not verified in the former
edition of that volume would be very acceptable to me. They should
be sent within the next fortnight.</p>
<p class="author">C. PAGE EDEN.</p>
<hr />
<h3>DR. THOMAS BEVER'S LEGAL POLITY OF GREAT BRITAIN.</h3>
<p>I do not know if such a notice as this is intended to be, is
admissible into your publication.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I bought of a bookseller a MS. intitled "A Short
History of the Legal and Judicial Polity of Great Britain,
attempted by Thos. Bever, LL.D., Advocate in Doctor's Commons, and
Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, 1759." It is presented to
Richard Pennant, Esq.; and there is a letter from Mr. Bever to Mr.
Pennant wafered to the fly-leaf. At the close of the
"Advertisement," the author "earnestly requests that it [the work]
may not be suffered to fall into the hands of a bookseller, or be
copied, without his consent: and whenever it shall become useless,
and lose its value (if any it ever had) with the present owner,
that he will be kind enough to return it to the author if living,
or if dead, to any of his surviving family at Mortimer near
Reading, Berks."</p>
<p>In pious sympathy with this wish, I more than thirty years since
wrote a letter, addressed to "&mdash;&mdash; Bever, Esq., Mortimer,
near Reading, Berks," offering to give up the volume to any one
entitled to it under the above description; but my letter was
returned from the post office with the announcement "Not found"
upon it. I make this other attempt, if you are pleased to admit it,
through you; and immediate attention will be paid to any claim
which may appear in your pages.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>DR. RICHARD HOLSWORTH AND THOS. FULLER.</h3>
<p>Can any of your readers inform me who was the author of <i>The
Valley of Vision</i>, published in 1651 as the work of Dr. Richard
Holsworth, the Master of Emmanuel College, and Dean of Worcester.
In a preface to the reader, Fuller laments "that so worthy a man
should dye issulesse without leaving any books behind him for the
benefit of learning and religion." He adds that the private notes
which he had left behind him were dark and obscure; his hand being
legible only to himself, and almost useless for any other. The
sermon published as <i>The Valley of Vision</i> appears to have
been prepared for publication from the notes of a short-hand
writer. When Fuller published, about eleven years afterwards, his
<i>Worthies of England</i>, he wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<h3>QUERIES UPON CUNNINGHAM'S HANDBOOK OF LONDON.</h3>
<p>We promised to make a few QUERIES on this amusing volume, and
thus redeem our promise.</p>
<p>Mr. Cunningham has been the first to point out the precise
situation of a spot often mentioned by our old dramatists, which
had baffled the ingenuity of Gifford, Dyce, and in fact of all the
commentators,&mdash;the notorious Picthatch. He thus describes
it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Picthatch</i>, or <i>Pickehatch</i>.&mdash;A famous
receptacle for prostitutes and pickpockets, generally supposed to
have been in <i>Turnmill Street</i>, near Clerkenwell Green, but
its position is determined by a grant of the 33rd of Queen
Elizabeth, and a survey of 1649. What <i>was</i> Picthatch is a
street at the back of a narrow turning called Middle Row (formerly
Rotten Row) opposite the Charter-house wall in Goswell Street. The
name is still preserved in 'Pickax Yard' adjoining Middle Row."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why then, among the curious illustrations which he has brought
to bear upon the subject, has Mr. Cunningham omitted that of the
origin of the name from the "picks upon the hatch?" which is
clearly established both by Malone and Steevens, in their notes
upon "'twere not amiss to keep our door hatch'd," in Pericles.</p>
<p>The following is an excellent suggestion as to the origin of
the&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Goat and Compasses.</i>&mdash;At Cologne, in the church of
Santa Maria in Capitolio, is a flat stone on the floor professing
to be the Grabstein der Br&uuml;der und Schwester eines ehrbaren
Wein-und Fass-Ampts, Anno 1693; that is, as I suppose, a vault
belonging to the Wine Coopers' Company. The arms exhibit a shield
with a pair of compasses, an axe, and a dray, or truck, with goats
for supporters. In a country like England, dealing so much at one
time in Rhenish wine, a more likely origin for such a sign could
hardly be imagined. For this information I am indebted to the
courtesy of Sir Edmund Head."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can Mr. Cunningham, Sir E. Head, or any of our correspondents
point out any German "Randle Holme" whose work may be consulted for
the purpose of ascertaining the arms, &amp;c. of the various
professions, trades, &amp;c. of that country?</p>
<p>Why has not Mr. Cunningham, in his description of <i>St. James'
Street</i>, mentioned what certainly existed long after the
commencement of the present century, the occasional "steps" which
there were in the foot-path&mdash;making the street a succession of
terraces. This fact renders intelligible the passage quoted from
Pope's letter to Mr. Pearse, in which he speaks of "y'e second
Terras in St. James' Street." Why, too, omit that characteristic
feature of the street, the rows of <i>sedan chairs</i> with which
it was formerly lined? The writer of this perfectly remembers
seeing Queen Charlotte in her sedan chair, going from the Queen's
Library in the Green Park to Buckingham House.</p>
<p>Mr. Cunningham states, we dare say correctly, that Sheridan died
at No. 17 Saville Row. We thought he had died at Mr. Peter Moore's,
in Great George Street, Westminster. Was he not living there
shortly before his death? and did not his funeral at Westminster
Abbey proceed from Mr. Moore's?</p>
<hr />
<h3>ON A PASSAGE IN MACBETH.</h3>
<p>If any of your correspondents would favour me, I should like to
be satisfied with respect to the following passage in Macbeth;
which, as at present punctuated, is exceedingly obscure:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well</p>
<p>It were done quickly: If the assassination</p>
<p>Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,</p>
<p>With his surcease, success; that but this blow</p>
<p>Might be the be-all and the end-all here,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page485" id=
"page485"></a>{485}</span>
<p>But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,&mdash;</p>
<p>We'd jump the life to come."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, I think by altering the punctuation, the sense of the
passage is at once made apparent, as thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"If it were done when 'tis done then 'twere well.</p>
<p>It were done quickly, if the assassination</p>
<p>Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,</p>
<p>With his surcease, success, that but this blow</p>
<p>Might be the be-all and the end all here," &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>but to make use of a paradox, it is <i>not</i> done when it
<i>is</i> done; for this reason, there is the conscience to torment
the evil-doer while living, and the dread of punishment in another
world after death: the "bank and shoal of time" refers to the
interval between life and death, and to "<i>jump</i>" the life to
come is to <i>hazard</i> it. The same thought occurs in
<i>Hamlet</i>, when he alludes to&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"That undiscovered country, from whose bourne</p>
<p>No traveller returns."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But that is clear enough, as in all probability the annotators
left the passage as they found it. I have not the opportunity of
consulting Mr. Collier's edition of Shakespeare, so that I am
unaware of the manner in which he renders it; perhaps I ought to
have done so before I troubled you. Possibly some of your readers
may be disposed to coincide with me in the "new reading;" and if
not, so to explain it that it may be shown it is my own obscurity,
and not Shakespeare's, with which I ought to cavil.</p>
<p>I have witnessed many representations of <i>Macbeth</i>, and in
every instance the passage referred to has been delivered as I
object to it: but that is not to be wondered at, for there are
professed admirers of Shakspeare among actors who read him
<i>not</i> as if they understood him, but who are&mdash;</p>

<h3>MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>As throng as Throp's Wife.</i>&mdash;As I was busy in my
garden yesterday, a parishioner, whose eighty-two years of age
render her a somewhat privileged person to have a gossip with, came
in to speak to me. With a view to eliciting material for a Note or
a Query, I said to her, "You see I am <i>as throng as Throp's
wife</i>;" to which she replied, "Aye, Sir, and <i>she</i> hanged
herself in the dishcloth." The answer is new to me; but the proverb
itself, as well as the one mentioned by "D.V.S." (No. 24. p. 382.)
"As lazy as Ludlum's dog, &amp;c.," has been an especial object of
conjecture to me as long as I can remember. I send this as a
pendant to "D.V.S.'s" Query, in hopes of shortly seeing the origin
of <i>both</i> these curious sayings.</p>

<p><i>Trimble Family.</i>&mdash;In a MS. account of the Fellows of
King's I find the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1530.&mdash;Rich. Trimble, a very merry fellow, the fiddle of
the society, who called him 'Mad Trimble.' M. Stokes of 1531 wrote
this distich on him:&mdash;</p>

<p>By which it appears he had a very small nose; and this day, July
13, 1739, I hear that there is one Mr. R. Trimble of an English
family, an apothecary at Lisburn in Ireland, who is remarkable for
the same."</p>

<p>As "NOTES AND QUERIES" circulate in Ireland, are there any of
the family of "Trimble" now in that country, and are they
distinguished by any such peculiarity?</p>

<p><i>The Word "Brozier."</i>&mdash;my brother Etonians will
feelingly recollect the word "Brozier," used by the boys for nearly
a century to denote any one who had spent his pocket-money; an
event of very frequent occurrence shortly after the holidays. There
were also sometimes attempts made to "<i>brozier my dame</i>," in
case a suspicion had arisen that the good lady's larder was not too
well supplied. The supper table was accordingly cleared of all the
provisions, and a further stock of eatables peremptorily
demanded.</p>
<p>I spell the word "brozier" as it is still pronounced; perhaps
some of your readers have seen it in print, and may be able to give
some account of its origin and etymology, and decide whether it is
exclusively belonging to Eton.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>
<h3>THE DODO QUERIES.</h3>
<p>There is no mention of the Solitaire as inhabiting Bourbon,
either in P&egrave;re Brown's letter or in the <i>Voyage de
l'Arabic Heureuse</i>, from whence the notice of the Oiseau Bleu
was extracted. I have since seen Dellon, <i>R&eacute;lation d'un
Voyage des Indes Orientales</i>, 2 vols. 12mo. Paris, 1685, in
which there is a brief notice of the Isle of Bourbon or Mascarin;
but neither the Dodo, the Solitaire, or the Oiseau Bleu are
noticed. The large Bat is mentioned, and the writer says that the
French who were on the island did not eat it, but only the Indians.
He also notices the tameness of the birds, and says that the
Flammand, with its long neck, is the only bird it was necessary to
use a gun against, the others being readily destroyed with a stick
or taken by hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Strickland's correction of the error about the monumental
evidence of the discovery of Bourbon by the Portuguese, in 1545,
will aid research into the period at which it was first visited and
named; but my stock of Portuguese literature is but small, and not
all of it accessible <span class="pagenum"><a name="page486" id=
"page486"></a>{486}</span> to me at present. In the meantime it may
be acceptable to Mr. Strickland to know, that there is a detailed
account of Portuguese discoveries in a book whose title would
hardly indicate it, in which one passage will probably interest
him. I allude to the rare and interesting folio volume printed at
Lisbon in 1571. <i>De Rebus Emanuelis Regis Lusitanie, invictissimi
Virtute et Auspicio Gestis, auctore Hieronymo Osorio Episcopo
Silvensis</i>. These annals embrace the period from 1495 to 1529.
In narrating the principal events of Vasco de Gama's first voyage,
after he had rounded the Cape of Good Hope on the 25th November,
1497, steering to the east along the southern coast of Africa, the
vessels anchor in the bay of St. Blaize, where&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In intimo sinu est parva qu&aelig;dam Insula, ad quam nostri
aquandi gratia naves-appulerunt. Ibi phocarum armenta conspexere
admiranda qu&aelig;dam multitudine. In quibus inerat tanta feritas
et truculentia, ut in homines irruerent. AVES etiam eo in loco
vis&aelig; sunt, quas incolas apellant SOLTICARIOS, pares anscribus
magnitudine: plumis minime vestiuntur, alas habent similes alis
verspertionum: volare nequeunt, sed explicatis alarum membranis,
cursum celeritate summa conficiunt."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The islet was probably that of <i>La Cruz</i>; but what were the
birds? and what was the indigenous name which is represented by
<i>Solticarios</i>? It is possible that some of your correspondents
may be familiar with the original narration which Osorio follows,
or Mr. Strickland may be able to solve the question.</p>
<p>I may just remark, that my observation respecting the
improbability of Tradescant's stuffed specimen having been a
fabrication could hardly be considered superfluous, seeing that
some naturalists, Dr. Gray, I believe, among others, had suggested
that it most probably was one.</p>

<h3>ABBEY OF ST. WANDRILLE.</h3>
<p>In reply to the Vicar of Ecclesfield (No. 24. p. 382.), I am
sorry to say that the "Chronicle of the Abby of St. Wandrille," to
which I alluded (No. 21. p. 338.), contains nothing relating to the
subject of his inquiry. The Abbey of Fontanelle, or St. Wandrille,
was founded A.D. 645; and this chronicle contains a very concise
account of a few only of its abbots and most celebrated members,
down to the year 834: written, it is supposed, by a cotemporary of
Ansegisus, the last abbot therein mentioned. It is followed by an
appendix containing a compilation from a book on miracles wrought
in the translation of the body of St. Wilfran, by an "eye-witness,"
which also recounts incidentally some of the acts of the abbots of
St. Wandrille to the year 1053. Acheri speaks of persons who had
been long engaged in collecting memorials of the history of this
abbey up to the time of his writing, 1659. Whether these have ever
been published, I have not the means at this moment of
ascertaining. Some account of this abbey, with views of its ruins,
will be found in that splendid work, <i>Voyages dans L'Ancienne
France</i>, by Nodier, &amp;c., vol. i.</p>
<p>The following notes from this chronicle may not be without
interest, as showing an early connection between the abbey and this
country, and our attachment to the See of Rome.</p>
<p>Chapter V. is devoted to the praise of BAGGA, a monk and
presbyter of this abbey, who is said to have been "ex
Britanni&acirc; Oceani insula Saxonico ex genere ortus." He died,
and was buried in the abbey, between the years 707 and 723; on
which occasion the Abbot Benignus is said to have exclaimed, "O
signifer fortissime Christi militi&aelig; BAGGA, nunc mercedem
laborum l&aelig;tus accipis tuorum. Deprecare ipsum benignum
Dominum, ut un&agrave; tecum mereamur gaudere consortiis justorum
per &aelig;vum." Here is a prayer not for, but <i>to</i> the
dead.</p>
<p>During the presidency of AUSTRULPHUS (ch. 13.), which began in
747 and ended in 753, a certain receptacle, in the form of a small
<i>pharos</i>, was driven ashore in the district of Coriovallum,
which contained a very fair copy of the four Gospels, beautifully
written in Roman characters on the purest vellum; and part of the
precious jaw of St. George the Martyr, as well as a portion of the
"health-bearing" wood of the true cross, duly labelled. The
acquisition of this treasure was of course ascribed to the
immediate interposition of God. And as about the same period the
head of St. George was discovered at Rome, through the intervention
of Pope Zachary, it was conjectured that this pontiff had given the
wonder-working relic to some venerable men from <i>Britain</i>, a
country described as being "always on the most intimate footing
(<i>maxim&egrave; familiares</i>) with the Apostolic See;" and
that, these being wrecked on their voyage home, or through some
other adventure, the said treasure was providentially driven ashore
at Coriovallum.</p>
<p>Chapter XV. gives us an account of GERVOLDUS, who ruled this
abbey eighteen years, dying A.D. 806. He had been ambassador from
Charlemagne to Offa, King of Mercia. The son of Charlemagne
demanded the daughter of Offa in marriage, who refused his consent,
unless his own son should receive the hand of Bertha, the daughter
of the French king. Charles, in consequence, inhibited the subjects
of Offa from trading on the French coast. This inhibition was,
however, withdrawn through the mediation of the Abbot Gervoldus,
who seems to have been in great favour with Charles.</p>
<p>I need hardly say, that throughout the chronicle there is a
tolerable sprinkling of the marvellous. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page487" id="page487"></a>{487}</span> I give
you the following as a warning to all dishonest bell-founders.</p>
<p>The pious builder of a church being desirous, according to
custom, of putting a bell in the turret, engaged a skillful
craftsman to carry into effect his design. This man, "at the
instigation of the devil," stole some of the metal with which he
had been furnished for the work; and the bell was, in consequence,
mis-shapen and of small size. It was, however, placed in the
turret; but, as a divine punishment for his crime, whenever the
bell was struck, the dishonest founder was thereupon seized with
frenzy, uttering strange words and barking like a dog!</p>

<h3>ORIGIN OF THE WORD "NEWS."</h3>
<p>I have great respect for "Mr. SAMUEL HICKSON," but I cannot
treat his derivation of the word "News" with any respect (No. 27.
p. 428.). I wish "Mr. HICKSON" had been a little more modest in his
manner of propounding his novelty. Can any thing be more dogmatic
than his assertions? which I will recapitulate as much as possible
in his own words, before I proceed to deal with them.</p>
<p>1. "I have never had the least doubt that this word is derived
immediately from the German."</p>
<p>2. "It is, in fact, 'das Neue' in the genitive case;" and "Mr.
H." proceeds to mention the German phrase, "Was giebt's Neues?" as
giving the exact sense of our "What is the news?" [which cannot be
gainsaid; but I shall have a word to say presently about
<i>neues</i> in that phrase being the genitive case.]</p>
<p>3. "That the word is not derived from the English adjective
'new,'&mdash;that it is not of English manufacture at all&mdash;I
feel well assured."</p>
<p>4. "In that case '<i>s</i>' would be the sign of the plural; and
we should have, as the Germans have, either extant or obsolete,
also 'the new.'" [I do not see the <i>sequitur</i>.]</p>
<p>5 "'News' is a noun singular, and as such must have been adopted
bodily into the language."</p>
<p>Such are "Mr. HICKSON's" principal assertions: and when I add,
that he has found out that the German "neu" was in olden time spelt
"new," so that the genitive, "newes," was identical with the old
form of the English word "news;" and that he explains the
transformation of a genitive case of a German adjective into an
English substantive by English ignorance, which he further thinks
is exemplified by the Koran having been called "the Alkoran," in
ignorance of "<i>Al</i>" meaning "the," I have given not only all
of his assertions, but also the whole of his argument.</p>
<p>I now proceed to assert on my part that the word "news" is not
"derived immediately from the German," and "has not been adopted
bodily into our language;" that the English "new" and German "neu"
have, however, of course the same origin, their common root being
widely spread in other languages, as [Greek: neos], Gr.;
<i>norus</i>, Lat.; <i>neuf</i>, Fr., &amp;c.; that "news" is a
noun of plural form and plural meaning, like <i>goods</i>,
<i>riches</i>, &amp;c.; that its peculiar and frequent use is quite
sufficient to account for its having come to be used as a singular
noun ("riches," by the way, may be prefixed sometimes to a singular
verb, as "riches is a cause of corruption"); that Mr. HICKSON might
as well say that "goods" is derived immediately from "gutes," the
genitive of "gut;" and "riches" from "reiches," the genitive of
"reich:" and also that if "<i>s</i>" in "goods," and "<i>es</i>" in
"riches" are signs of the plural, "we should have, as the Germans
have, either extant or obsolete," the "good," "the rich," (not that
I quite understand this part of "Mr. HICKSON's" argument): and,
lastly, I assert that I believe that <i>Neues</i>, in the phrase
"Was giebt's Neues?" is not the genitive, but the nominative
neuter, so that the phrase is to be literally translated "What is
there new?"</p>
<p>As regards the derivation of "News," I wish you had allowed the
question to rest as it stood after the sensible remarks of "A.E.B."
(No. 23. p. 369.). Pray excuse me, Sir, for expressing a hope that
you will ponder well before you again allow us to be puzzled on so
plain a subject, and give circulation and your sanction to
paradoxes, even though coming from one so entitled to attention as
"Mr. HICKSON."</p>
<p>The early communication between the English and German
languages, of which "Mr. HICKSON" puts forward the derivation of
"news" from "neues" as an instance, may be an interesting and
profitable subject of inquiry; but as I think he has been
singularly unfortunate in the one instance, so I do not think him
particularly happy in his other. I see no further resemblance
between Heywood's "Song in praise of his Mistress," and the early
German poem, than what <i>might</i> arise from treatment of the
same and a very common subject.</p>
<p>I am not enough of an etymologist to give you the root of the
word "noise." But my faith in "Mr. HICKSON" in this capacity is not
strong enough to lead me to believe, on his dictum, that "news" and
"noise" are the same word; and when, pursuing his fancy about
"neues," he goes on to say that "noise" is "from a dialect from
which the modern German pronunciation of the dipthong is derived,"
I fear his pronunciation of German is faulty, if he pronounces
<i>eu</i> in "Neues" like <i>oi</i> in "noise."</p>
<p class="note">[We differ from our correspondent on this point,
and think that here, at all events, Mr. HICKSON has the advantage
of the argument.]</p>
<p>I beg to repeat that for "Mr. HICKSON" I feel great respect. If
he knew my name, he would probably know nothing about me; but I
happen <span class="pagenum"><a name="page488" id=
"page488"></a>{488}</span> to know of him, what perhaps, some of
your readers do not, that he has unostentatiously rendered many
considerable services not only to literature but to our social and
political interests. In my humble opinion, his recent essay in your
columns on <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> is a contribution to our
literary history which you may be proud of having published. But I
feel that I cannot too strongly protest against his derivation of
"News."</p>

Cambridge University mentioned in Lord Lauderdale's letter to Dr.
Whichcot, is the Earl of Manchester. Shaftesbury was never either
Lord Chamberlain or Chancellor of Cambridge.</p>
<p>I may mention that Whichcot's intimacy with Lord Shaftesbury
would probably have been brought about by his being incumbent of
the church of St. Lawrence Jewry, Shaftesbury having his London
house in the latter part of his life in Aldersgate Street.</p>
<p>If it is not committing unpardonable trespass on that useful
part of your publication in which books and odd volumes are asked

Elizabeth were in ancient times used indifferently, and
particularly in the reigns of Edward I. and Edward III. Mr. Hardy
says in his evidence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the British Museum there is a Latin letter of Elizabeth of
Austria, Queen of Charles IX. of France, to Queen Elizabeth of
England. In the Latin she is called Elizabetha, and she signs her
name Ysabel. In the <i>Chronicle de St. Denis</i>, in the year
1180, it is stated, 'Le jor martmes espousa la noble Roine Ysabel,'
'Upon this day, Queen Elizabeth was married;' and in <i>Rigordus de
Gestis Philippi Augusti Regis Francois</i> it is stated, 'Tune
inuncta fuit Elizabeth uxor ejus venerabilis foemina;' and Moreri
says she is called 'Elizabeth or Izabeau de Hainault, Queen of
France, wife of Philippe Auguste.' Camden, in his <i>Remains</i>,
says, 'Isabel is the same as Elizabeth;' that the Spaniards always
translate Elizabeth into Isabel, and the French into Izabeau. I
have seen in the British Museum a deed, in which the name
Elizabetha is written in Latin; on the seal it is Isabella. In the
<i>Inquisitiones post Mortem</i> I have frequently seen Ysabella
returned in one country and Elizabetha in an other for the same
person. I have something like a dozen other instances from Moreri,
in which he says that Elizabeth and Isabella or Isabeau are the
same. Elizabeth or Izabeau de France, dau. of Lewis VIII. and
Blanche of Castella; Elizabeth or Isabelle d'Aragon, Queen of
France, wife of Philippe III., surnamed le Hardie; Elizabeth or

<p><i>Elizabeth&mdash;Isabel.</i>&mdash;The Greek word [Greek:
Elisabet] (Luke, i. 5. &amp;c.) from which Elizabeth, or
<i>Elisabeth</i>, must have been adopted as a Christian name, is
used by the LXX. (Exodus, vi. 23.) to express the Hebrew [Hebrew:
Elisheba], the name of Aaron's wife. This at once directs us to the
verb [Hebrew: shaba], or rather to its Niphal, [Hebrew: nishba],
for the <i>Kal</i> form does not occur, <i>to swear</i>; for the
combination of letters in [Hebrew: el isshaba], <i>God will
swear</i>, or <i>God sweareth</i>, is the same as that in the
proper name. Now let us transpose the verb and its nominative case,
and we have [Hebrew: ishaba el], which a Greek translator might
soften into [Greek: Isabel].</p>
<p>The use of [Greek: Elisabet] both by the LXX. and the
Evangelist, makes it probable that the mother of John the Baptist,
who was <i>of the daughters of Aaron</i> (Luke, i. 5.), was known
amongst her own people by the recognized and <i>family</i> name of
<i>Elisheba</i>, as <i>Anna</i> no doubt would be <i>Hannah</i>
([Hebrew: hanah]), and <i>Mary, Miriam</i> ([Greek: Mariam], Luke,
i. 27.). And this is confirmed by the Syriac version, the
vernacular, or nearly so, of Our Blessed Lord and His disciples,
which has [Syriac: elisheba].</p>
<p>Genesius, in his <i>Lexicon</i>, explains Elisheba to mean "cui
Deus est sacramentum," "qu&aelig; jurat per Deum, <i>i.e.</i> Dei
cultrix: cf. Is. xix. 18." I should rather take it to be a name
expressive of trust in God's promises or oath, such as
<i>Elijah</i>, "the LORD is my God;" <i>Isaiah</i>, "the LORD is my
salvation;" <i>Ezekiel</i>, "God strengtheneth." Schleusner
(<i>Lex. N.T.</i>) says that others derived it from [Hebrew: saba],
<i>saturavit</i>; "sic in Alberti <i>Gloss. N.T.</i>, p. 87.
explicatur, [Greek: Theou mou plaesmonae]." Wolfius, in his note on
Luke, i. 5., refers to Witsii <i>Miscellanea</i>, tom. ii. p. 478.,
to which I must refer your correspondent "A.C.," as I have not the
book by me.</p>
<p>Camden must, of course, have derived the name <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>{489}</span> from
[Hebrew: shabath], <i>to rest</i>; but I think we must rather defer
to the authority of the LXX. And though [Hebrew: el ishaboth] may
give us <i>Elisabeth</i>, we shall not be able to deduce
<i>Isabel</i> from [Hebrew: ishboth el] quite so easily.</p>

from an unauthorised publication in 1651, which misled Park in his

<p>"There are three copies of verses on that model; two of which,
viz., one of four stanzas and another of size, were printed by Byrd
in 1588. They have been reprinted from his text in <i>Cens. Lit</i>
ii. 108-110, and <i>Exc. Tudor</i>, i. 100-103. Percy inserted them
in the <i>Reliques</i> with some alterations and additions; but he
changed his mind more than once as to whether they were two
distinct poems, or only the discovered parts of one (see i.
292-294. 303., ed. 1767; and i. 307-310. ed. 1839). The third
(containing four stanzas) is among Sylvester's <i>Posthumous
Poems</i> p. 651.; and Ellis reprinted it under his name. In
<i>Cens. Lit.</i> ii. 102., another copy of it is given from a
music book by Gibbons, 1612. Now the longest, and apparently the
earliest of these poems is signed 'E. DIER,' in MS. Rawl. Poet.
35., fol. 17. That copy contains <i>eight</i> stanzas, and one of
the two which are not in Byrd corresponds with a stanza which Percy
added. The following are the reasons which incline us to trust this
MS.:&mdash;(1.) Because it is the very MS. to which reference is
commonly made for several of Dyer's unprinted poems, as by Dr.
Bliss, <i>A.O.</i> i. 743.; and apparently by Mr. Dyce, ed. of
Greene, i. p. xxxv. n.; and by Park, note on Warton, iii. 230. Park
is the only person I can recollect who has mentioned this
particular poem in the MS., and he cannot have read more than the
first line, for he only says, 'one of them bears the popular burden
of "My mind to me a kingdom is."' (2.) Because it is quite
impossible that Dyer wrote many extant poems, of which he is not
known to be the author; for, as Mr. Dyce says, none of his
(<i>acknowledged</i>) productions 'have descended to our times that
seem to justify the contemporary applause which he received.' (3.)
Because I cannot discover that there is any other claimant to this
poem. One of Greene's poems ends with the line,</p>

another.</p>
<p>The English nobleman murdered at Pontoise was Charles Smith,
Viscount Carrington of Barrefen, Ireland, and Baron Carrington of
Wotton Warem, co. Warwick; the date in the pedigrees of the murder
is usually given 1666, probably March 1665-6.</p>
<p>The last Lord Carrington died 17 May, 1706: the estates of
Wotton came to Lewis Smith, who married Eliz., daughter of William
Viscount Monson, and relict of Sir Philip Hungate. His son Francis
Smith Carrington died in 1749, and left one daughter and heir. What
relation was Lewis Smith to the Smiths Lord Carrington? No pedigree
gives the connection.</p>

way, Bankes says it was his <i>son</i> John who fell at Alresford,

<p><i>Esquires and Gentlemen.</i>&mdash;I would ask your
correspondent (No. 27. p. 437.), whether he has ascertained <i>the
grounds of distinction</i> made in the seventeenth and in the early
part of the eighteenth century, between <i>esquires</i> and
<i>gentlemen</i>, when both were landed proprietors? We find lists
of names of governors of hospitals, trustees, &amp;c., where this
distinction is made, and which, apparently, can only be accounted
for on this ground, that the estates of the gentleman were smaller
in extent than those of the esquire; and, consequently, that the
former was so far a person of less consideration. Had the bearing
of coat armour, or a connection with knighthood, any thing to do
with the matter?</p>

<p><i>Early Inscriptions.</i>&mdash;The excellent remarks by
"T.S.D." on "Arabic Numerals, &amp;c." (No. 18. p. 279.) have put
me in mind of two cases which in some degree confirm the necessity
for his caution respecting pronouncing definitively on the
authenticity of old inscriptions, and especially those on "Balks
and Beams" in old manorial dwellings. The house in which I spent
the greater portion of my youth was a mansion of the olden time,
whose pointed gables told a tale of years; and whose internal walls
and principal floors, both below and above stairs, were formed of
"raddle and daub." It had formerly belonged to a family of the name
of Abbot; but the "last of the race" was an extravagant libertine,
and after spending a handsome patrimonial estate, ended his days as
a beggar. Abbot House was evidently an ancient structure; but
unfortunately, as tradition stated, a stone, bearing the date of
its erection, had been carelessly lost during some repairs.
However, in my time, on the white wainscot of a long lobby on the
second floor, the initials, "T.H. 1478," were distinctly traced in
black paint, and many persons considered this as nothing less than
a "true copy" of the lost inscription. Subsequent inquiry, however,
finally settled the point; for the inscription was traced to the
rude hand of one of the workmen formerly employed in repairing the
building, who naively excused himself by declaring that he
considered it "a pity so old a house should be without a year of
our Lord."</p>
<p>The second instance is that of the occurrence of "four nearly
straight lines" on one of the compartments of a fine old font in
Stydd Church, near Ribchester, which many visitors have mistaken
for the date "1178." A closer scrutiny, however, soon dispels the
illusion; and a comparison of this with similar inscriptions on the
old oak beams of the roof, soon determines it to be nothing more
than a rude, or somewhat defaced, attempt to exhibit the sacred
monogram "I.H.S."</p>

<p><i>American Aborigines called Indians</i> (No. 16. p.
254.).&mdash;I believe the reason is that the continent in which
they live passed under the name of <i>India</i>, with the whole of
the New World discovered at the close of the fifteenth century. It
is, of course, unnecessary to dwell upon the fact of Columbus
believing he had discovered a new route to India by sailing due
west; or upon the acquiescence of the whole world in that idea, the
effects of which have not yet passed away; for we not only hear in
Seville, even now, of the "India House" meaning house of management
of affairs for the "New World," but we even retain ourselves the
name of the West Indies, given as unwarrantably to the islands of
the Caribbean Sea. It is needless to do more than allude to this,
and to other misnomers still prevalent, notwithstanding the fact of
the notions or ideas under which the names were originally given
having long since been exploded; such as the "four quarters of the
globe," the "four elements," &amp;c. If your correspondent searches
for the solution of his difficulty on different grounds from those
I have mentioned, it would not satisfy him to be more diffuse; and
if the whole reason be that which I conceive, quite enough has been
said upon the subject.</p>

Columbus, when he landed at Guanahani (now called Cat Island), he
thought, in conformity with his theory of the spherical shape of
the earth, that he had landed on one of the islands lying at the
eastern extremity of India; and with this belief he gave the
inhabitants the name of Indians. The following quotations will

Bitton.</p>
<p>There are no monuments remaining.</p>
<p>Highfield, with the manor of Upton Cheyney, was a considerable
estate in 1627, where it was passed by fine from John and Mary
Barker to Vincent Gookin, Esq.</p>
<p>In 1646, Vincent Gookin, Esq. (no doubt the knight's
<i>son</i>), and Mary his wife, and Robert Gookin their son, Gent.,
passed the same estates by fine to Dr. Samuel Bave, after which it
is supposed the Gookins left the parish. In Sims' <i>Index</i> are
references to pedigrees under <i>Gokin, Kent</i>. Any further
notices of <i>Sir</i> Vincent or his son would be acceptable to</p>

<p><i>Sneck up</i> (No. 29, p. 467.)&mdash;All Shakspearean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page493" id=
"page493"></a>{493}</span> students will be deeply indebted to you
for giving insertion to articles on obsolete words and phrases, so
many of which are to found in the pages of the great poet. The
article by R.R. is very interesting, but I apprehend that the
passage from Taylor, first quoted by Weber, is sufficient to show
that the phrase <i>sneck up</i> was equivalent to <i>be hanged</i>!
See Halliwell, p. 766, on the phrase, that writer not connecting it
with <i>sneck</i>, to latch. Compare, also, <i>Wily
Beguiled</i>,&mdash;"An if mistress would be ruled by him, Sophos
might go <i>snick up</i>." And the <i>Two Angry Women of
Abingdon</i>, 1599,&mdash;"If they be not, let them go <i>snick
up</i>," <i>i.e.</i> let them go and be hanged! These passages will
not be consistently explained on R.R.'s principle.</p>
<p class="author">R.</p>
<p><i>Hanap</i> (No. 29. p. 477.).&mdash;I have a few notes by me
relative to the drinking vessel, which may, perchance, be
acceptable to some of your readers. It was similar to the
<i>standing cup</i> and grace cup, as these vessels were
subsequently called, being raised from the table by a foot and
stem, for the convenience of passing it round the table for the
company to pledge each other out of; it was thus distinguished from
the <i>cup</i>, which was smaller, and only used by one person. The
hanap frequently occurs in wills and inventories of the thirteenth,
fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries.</p>
<p>In the will of Lady Calre, 1355,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Je devise a ma joefne fille Isabel Bardolf en cide de lui
marier un <i>hanap</i> plat door."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in that of the Earl of March, 1389,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Item. nous devisons a notre treschier friere Mons'r. Henri, un
<i>hanaper</i> de tortelez ove un ostelle en le founce."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very elegant specimen is described in the will of the Duchess
of Gloucester, 1390,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Un <i>hanappe</i> de Beril gravez de long taille, et assis en
un pe&eacute; d'or, ove un large bordur paramont, et un covercle
tout d'or, ove un saphir sur le pomel du dit covercle."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an inventory 19th Henry VI. we find&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Une haute coupe d'argent enorrez appellez <i>l'anap</i> de les
pinacles pois de troie vii lb pris la lb xl. Summa xiii li."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And temp. Edward II 1324,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Un hanap a pee de la veille fazon quillere et cymelle el founz
du pois xxix, du pris xl."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same document several others are described having feet. I
could give many other quotations, but will conclude with only one
more, as in the last occurs the word <i>kyrymyry</i>, of which I
should like to know the derivation, if any of your readers can
assist me:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Item, un hanap d ore covere del ovrage d un <i>kyrymyry</i> et
iij scochons des armes d Engleterre et de Franuce en le sumet."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have met with notices of cups "covered of <i>kerimery</i>
work," and "chacez et pounsonez en lez founcez faitz de
<i>kermery</i>;" and the following, from the <i>Vision of Piers
Ploughman</i>, would seem to indicate a sort of veil or
net-work:&mdash;</p>

<h3>MISCELLANIES</h3>
<p><i>Bishop Burnet as an Historian.</i>&mdash;Dr. Joseph Warton
told my father that "Old Lord Barthurst," Pope's friend, had
cautioned him against relying implicitly on all Burnet's
statements; observing that the good bishop was so given to
gossiping and anecdote hunting, that the wags about court used
often to tell him idle tales, for the mischievous pleasure of
seeing him make note on them. Lord Bathurst did not, I believe,
charge Burnet with deliberate misrepresentation, but considered
some of his presumed facts <i>questionable</i>, for the reason
stated.</p>
<p class="author">ELIJAH WARING.</p>
<p><i>Dance Thumbkin.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Book of Nursery
Rhymes</i>, published by the Percy Society, there is a small error
of importance, involving no less that the learned would call "a non
sequitur," and which, if my correct-and-almost-unequalled nurse,
Betty Richins, was alive, she would have noticed much sooner that
the nurseling who now addresses you. (She died about the year
1796.) In the valuable and still popular nursery classical song,
"Dance Thumbkin, dance," it is not only an error to say "Thumbkin
<i>he can</i> dance alone" (let any one reader of the "NOTES AND
QUERIES," male or female, <i>only try</i>), but it is not the
correct text. Betty Richins has "borne me on her knee a hundred
times" and sung it thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Thumbkin <i>cannot</i> dance alone.</p>
<p>So<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> dance ye merry men, every one."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I scarcely need add, that if this be true of Thumbkin, it is
<i>truer</i> of Foreman, Longman, Middleman, and Littleman.</p>

<p><i>King's Coffee-house, Covent Garden.</i>&mdash;As an addition
to "Mr. RIMBAULT's" Notes on Cunningham's <i>Handbook</i>, the
following extract from Harwood's <i>Alumni Etonenses</i>, p. 293.,
in the recount of the boys elected for Eton to King's College may
be interesting:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A.D. 1713, 12."</p>
<p>"Thomas King born at West Ashton in Wiltshire; went away
scholar, in apprehension that his fellowship <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page494" id="page494"></a>{494}</span> would be
denied him, and afterwards kept that coffee-house in Covent Garden
which was called by his own name."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="author">J.H.L.</p>
<p><i>Spur Money</i> (No. 23. p. 374, and No 28. p. 462.).&mdash;In
a curious tract, published in 1598, under the title of <i>The
Children of the Chapel stript and whipt</i>, we have the following
passage:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wee think it very necessarye that every quorister sholde bringe
with him to churche a Testament in Englishe, and turne to everie
chapter as it is daily read, or som other good and godly
prayer-booke, rather than spend their tyme in talk and hunting
after <i>spur-money</i>, whereon they set their whole mindes, and
do often abuse dyvers if they doe not bestowe somewhat on
them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1622, the dean of the Chapel Royal issued an order by which
it was decreed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That if anie Knight, or other persone entituled to weare spurs,
enter the chappell in that guise, he shall pay to y'e quiristers
the accustomed fine; but if he command y'e youngest quirister to
repeate his <i>Gamut</i>, and he faile in y'e so doing, the said
Knight, or other, shall not pay y'e fine."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This curious extract I copied from the ancient cheque-book of
the Chapel Royal.</p>
<p>Within my recollection, His Grace the Duke of Wellington (who,
by the way, is an excellent musician) entered the Royal Chapel
"booted and spurred," and was, of course, called upon for the fine.
But His Grace calling upon the youngest chorister to repeat his
GAMUT, and the "little urchin" failing, the impost was not
demanded.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>
<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, CATALOGUES, SALES, ETC.</h3>
<p>Mr. W.S.W. Vaux, of the department of Antiquities, British
Museum, has just published a very interesting little volume under
the title of <i>Nineveh and Persepolis: an Historical Sketch of
Ancient Assyria and Persia, with an Account of the recent
Researches in those Countries</i>. The work is illustrated with
numerous woodcuts; and the two points which Mr. Vaux has proposed
to elucidate,&mdash;viz., 1. The history of Assyria and Persia,
and, as connected with it, that of the Medes, the Jews, and the
Chaldees, so far as it can be ascertained from the Bible, and the
works of classical authors: and 2. The results of those inquiries
which have been carried on for nearly three centuries by European
travellers,&mdash;he has successfully accomplished, in a way to
make his book a most useful introduction to the study of the larger
works which have been written upon this important subject; and a
valuable substitute to those who have neither the means to purchase
them, nor time to devote to their perusal.</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Maitland has just published a second edition of his
<i>Eruvin, or Miscellaneous Essays on Subjects connected with the
Nature, History, and Destiny of Man</i>. The Essays are ten in
number, and treat: I. On the Nature and Objects of Revelation. II.
On the Impediments to the Right Understanding of Scripture. III.
Man before the Fall. IV. Satan. V. The Consequences of the Fall.
VI. The Fallen Angels. VII. The Millenium. VIII. The Kingdom of
Messiah. IX. The Regeneration. X. The Modern Doctrine of Miracles.
We mention the subjects of these papers because, although they are
of a nature not to be discussed in our columns, we are sure many of
our readers will be glad to know the points on which they
treat.</p>

<p>"Ewerby is a magnificent specimen of a Flowing Middle-Pointed
Church. It is most perfectly measured and described; one can follow
the most recondite beauties of the construction, mouldings and
joints, in these Plates, almost as well as in the original
structure. Such a monograph as this will be of incalculable value
to the architects of our Colonies or the United States, who have no
means of access to ancient churches. The Plates are on stone, done
with remarkable skill and distinctness. Of Heckington we can only
say that the perspective view from the south-east presents a very
vision of beauty; we can hardly conceive anything more perfect. We
heartily recommend this series to all who are able to patronize
it."&mdash;<i>Ecclesiologist</i>, Oct. 1849.</p>

<p>It contains above 50,000 Words (embodying all the known

key to the reader of the works of our old Poets, Dramatists,
Theologians, and other authors whose works abound with allusions,

<p>"To those who wish to possess a critical knowledge of their own
native English, some acquaintance with Anglo-Saxon is
indispensable; and we have never seen an introduction better
calculated than the present to supply the wants of a beginner in a

stated, and illustrated by references to the Greek, Latin, French,

extracts from Anglo-Saxon History and the Saxon Chronicle. There is
a good glossary at the end."&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, Oct. 20.

<p>This new and much improved edition, besides a great enlargement
of the chapters contained in the previous editions, comprises
several that are entirely new, together with Notes on Scottish,
Irish, and Norman Surnames. The "Additional Prolusions," besides
the articles on Rebuses, Allusive Arms, and the Roll of Battel
Abbey, contain Dissertations on Inn Signs, and Remarks on Christian
Names; with a copious Index of many thousand names. These features
render "English Surnames" rather a new work than a new edition.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
